The proposed solution leverages a sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model to analyze environmental data, particularly satellite images, in order to perform various classification and prediction tasks related to environmental aspects. This particular model was selected as the pre trained famous models like resnet, movienet couldn't provide the accuracy required by us hence we developed our own basic sequential CNN model to achieve it  without overfitting, we added the necessary layers, and optimized it to suit the dataset. 

This particular solution is suited to the GEO AI: reimagined problem statement as the proposed solution directly addresses the challenge by utilizing geospatial foundation models, fine-tuning them for specific tasks, and applying AI for improved accuracy and efficiency in disaster recovery and environmental monitoring, even when labeled data is limited.

The  Key functionalities of this solution include:

1. Deforestation Detection: The CNN model is designed to identify deforestation areas within the satellite images, allowing for real-time monitoring and intervention.

2. Land Type Classification: It can classify land types, such as forests, baren land and deforested areas 

3. Future Deforestation Prediction: By integrating data on industrial growth and other relevant factors, the model can predict future deforestation in specific areas, providing valuable insights for conservation efforts.

4. Land Cover Change Assessment: The solution assesses changes in land cover over time, helping researchers and environmentalists track alterations in ecosystems and habitats.
